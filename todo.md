# Todo List for Ethco AI Project

## Phase 1: Clone repository and analyze existing codebase
- [x] Clone the repository: `https://github.com/nexuss0781/Ai-app.git`
- [x] Analyze the existing codebase to understand its structure and functionalities.

## Phase 2: Create comprehensive todo.md and project planning
- [x] Create `todo.md` file.
- [x] Add `/workspace` to `.gitignore`.
- [x] Detail out all remaining tasks in `todo.md` based on the updated plan.

## Phase 3: Implement persistent history system
- [x] Design a database schema for storing conversation history. (Already exists in `models.py`)
- [x] Implement backend API endpoints for saving and retrieving history. (Already exists in `app.py` and `chat_routes.py`)
- [x] Integrate history functionality into the frontend. (This will be part of UI modernization)

## Phase 4: Modernize UI/UX and add content management features
- [x] Analyze existing templates and UI structure
- [x] Redesign the user interface to be modern and intuitive.
- [x] Implement features for adding and modifying content within the AI app.

## Phase 5: Implement LLM thinking loop with sandbox capabilities
- [x] Develop a mechanism for the LLM to perform thinking loops in a sandboxed environment.
- [x] Create a collapsible thinking box in the UI to display the LLM's thought process.
- [x] Integrate the LLM's output from the thinking box into the main chat window.

## Phase 6: Add visual tool icons and transform tool usage strings
- [x] Design or find appropriate visual icons for each tool.
- [x] Modify the frontend to display visual icons instead of raw tool usage strings.

## Phase 7: Upgrade prompt engineering system
- [ ] Review and analyze the existing `prompt.md`.
- [ ] Rewrite `prompt.md` to incorporate modern and advanced prompt engineering techniques for general-purpose AI.

## Phase 8: Implement advanced automation for coding and research
- [ ] Develop modules for automating coding tasks (e.g., code generation, debugging, refactoring).
- [ ] Implement features for automating research tasks (e.g., information gathering, synthesis, report generation).

## Phase 9: Final review, testing, and deployment preparation
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing of all new features and functionalities.
- [ ] Review the entire project for code quality, performance, and security.
- [ ] Prepare the application for deployment, ensuring all dependencies are met and configurations are correct.
